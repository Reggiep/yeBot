# yeBot V1.0

I made this project to practice using the Discord API and Javascript

yeBot is a very simple Discord bot with several functions.  It can play blackjack and roulette with the server users, as well as join a voice channel and play music from a youtube link.  Participation in the Discord rewards the users with a currency, this currency is used to bet on the games and play music.  

yeBot requires FFMPEG to work properly and play music
